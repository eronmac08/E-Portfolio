Hello,

I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Geomatics for Environmental Management at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada. I hold a B.Sc. in Environmental Science and Marine Biology from Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA.

With my undergraduate background, I spent four years working on salmon stock assessments with both U.S. Fish and Wildlife and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife on the West Coast. Now, I am seeking to transition into a career that combines my expertise in geomatics with my strong foundation in biological sciences, focusing on GIS and its applications in environmental management.
