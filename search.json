    "text": "Hello,\nI am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Geomatics for Environmental Management at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada (Expected Graduation April 5th, 2025). I hold a B.Sc. in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Marine Ecology from Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA.\nWith my undergraduate background, I spent four years working on salmon stock assessments with both U.S. Fish and Wildlife and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife on the West Coast of Washington State. Currently, I am seeking to transition into a career that combines my expertise in geomatics with my strong foundation in biological sciences, focusing on GIS and its applications in environmental management."

Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (“On this page”).\nIf you’ve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nIndividual tree segmentation derived from a LiDAR point cloud using the Dalponte et al. (2016) algorithm in R (Verion 4.3.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto. It is good practice to try and convert your R code to python, and vice-versa to demonstrate coding proficiency. For example, let’s showcase a function for calculating NDVI in R and Python.\n\nRPython\n\n\ncalc_ndvi &lt;- function(nir, red){ ndvi &lt;- (nir-red)/(nir+red) return(ndvi) }\n\n\ndef calc_ndvi(nir, red): \n  ndvi = (nir.astype(float)-red.astype(float))/(nir.astype(float)+red.astype(float))\n  return(ndvi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also provide a frame linking to external websites. For example, here is a link to a Google Earth Engine application I developed. The full-screen GEE application is available here in case you’re interested.\n(To use the GEE tool, navigate to any city you’d like, hit apply filters, and click anywhere on the map to retrieve a time-series of Landsat surface temperature observations for that point.
