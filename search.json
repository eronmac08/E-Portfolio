    "text": "About Me\nHello,\nI am a Master’s student in Geomatics for Environmental Management at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, BC, Canada, with an expected graduation date of April 5th, 2025. I also hold a B.Sc. in Environmental Science with a focus on Marine Ecology from Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA.\nAfter my undergraduate studies, I spent four years contributing to salmon stock assessments through collaborations with both U.S. Fish and Wildlife and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife on the West Coast of Washington State. This hands-on experience helped me build a strong foundation in geospatial analysis, biological sciences and environmental research.\nCurrently, I am eager to transition into a career that blends my geomatics expertise with my passion for environmental management. I am particularly focused on exploring the the world of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and their applications in addressing pressing environmental challenges.\n\n\nSkills\n\nProcient in GIS software: ArcGIS Pro, QGIS\nProgramming languages: Python, R\nSpatial data analysis and manipulation\nRemote sensing and cartographic design\nDatabase management: SQL, Microsoft Acces"

Every header you use will correspond to a tab in the legend - shown on the right-hand side of your screen (“On this page”).\nIf you’ve produced any GIS layers for your 599 project, this may be a good place to share them as interactive maps through leaflet. Alternatively, you can upload high-res figures showing correlations, box-plots, etc. from your report here, and provide a brief overview of key project results. If you have written some useful functions, you may also want to share those here to demonstrate proficiency in particular coding languages or synergies between notable coding packages.\n\n\nIndividual tree segmentation derived from a LiDAR point cloud using the Dalponte et al. (2016) algorithm in R (Verion 4.3.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample code snippet. Notice that you can provide a toggle to switch between coding languages - this is referred to as a ‘tabset’ in quarto.
